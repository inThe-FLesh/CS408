# Determining the Suitability of Hashing Algorithms for Password Security Using GPU Acceleration - Ross Gray CS408 

<p>This repository holds code that is part of my submission for CS408. The hashing algorithms contained are for research purposes only.  <br><br>
They should not be used for any real world applications, and have not been tested to the level of standard implementations.  <br><br>
This code has been written and tested in Linux and may not be compatible with windows. The binaries provided are compiled for linux.  <br><br>
Therefore, it is highly recommended that linux is used to run the binaries or compile the code.
